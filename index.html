    <div>Hello everyone My name is Max. Life turned out so that I had to part for a while with my beloved and incredible dog - Raf. Now we are in different countries. Time is passing, it has been many months, and the opportunity to regain it has not appeared. The most important problem is the money issue. I just don't have the means to move him.</div>
    <div>Yes, each of us faces a lot of difficulties in life, and we have to overcome them. We miss each other a lot. And I hope maybe there will be caring people who could help us financially (Card transaction or Binance).</div>
    <div>You can contact me at: <ul>
      <li>WhatsApp (+79531473369)</li>
      <li>Instagramm (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/best_dog_return_to_owner/" target="_blank">best_dog_return_to_owner)</a></li>
      <li>or mail: mstroy54@gmail.com</li>
    </ul>
    and I will provide you with more detailed information, and if you are interested, I can tell you our story in more detail.</div>
    <div>No, this is not a divorce for money. This is really a real life situation, and this is really my dog. If you wish, I can provide you with a photo confirmation during correspondence.</div>
    <div class="niz">Peace and kindness to all! I would be grateful to everyone for their help!</div>
